This is the first Post. Uh, that's difficult. What should I write?
- Ah, I know something!

This is my first encounter with Jekyll and GitHub Pages at all and so far I love it.
It's simple and fast as I like software and projects I do or use in general.

Sometimes a full fledged CMS is to much and adds a lot of unnecessary complexity.
From a Developers Point of View: KISS (Keep it simple, stupid.)

You may think one or more of these following things:

1. This website is ugly
2. This website has no important content
3. And gosh, why am I reading this!

If you are in this group of people thinking this you are not alone.
I will build this Website and am not completely sure about doing it with all your eyes on the build progression... but I will do!
But why?
- I believe in Free as in Freedom Software and maybe there is someone who can reuse parts of my codes or learn form my progression.

Feel free to browse the Repo over at GitHub

Cheers!
