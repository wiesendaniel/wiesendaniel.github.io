Well, there is not much to tell about me. Or at least I think it's hard to describe myself.
Some how I think it's hard for everyone to find the right words to describe her/his/it self.

So, it's up to you to get to konw me if you'd like to.

But maybe there are a few things I can say beforehand

1. I love (love, love) the Interwebs and (mostly) all it is and represents
2. As you probably saw in the description of this site:

    2.1 I'm a Webdev (If you want to find out more about what I do, you may want to read the "Skills page")
    2.2 I have a big spot in my hard for Opensorce and Free as in Freedom Software (Big shout out to RMS)
3. I like to play the guitar (Don't ask me to play. It's horrible) and creating and listening to music in general
4. I spend a lot of my spare time watching TV-Shows like Doctor Who, Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones (and a hell lot of others)

    4.1 I may be kind of the Human incarnation of thetvdb.com
5. And as you probably noticed by looking at my english writing: I'm from germany near DÃ¼sseldorf (yep, thats a true german umlaut)
6. Ok, ok, my english isn't that bad at all or is it? You may have to decide!

Now I'm out of bulletpoints I think. Feel free to add something via Pull-Request over at the GitHub Repo if you think I missed something. ;-)
